Since there are hundreds of different programming languages and talking about all of them would be like writing a longer version of bible, I'll just scale down and talk about python.

### Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked?

For linting, tools like pylint and flake8 are popular choices. They analyze code for potential errors, enforce coding standards, and help maintain code quality. For testing, pytest is widely used due to its simplicity and powerful features. It supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has a vast ecosystem of plugins. For building, tools like setuptools and poetry are commonly used to manage dependencies and package the application.

### What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions?

Firstly the is  GitLab CI/CD that offers integrated CI/CD within GitLab. Travis CI is another option. Google says it's well known but I didn't know about it before. Its favored for its ease of integration with GitHub and strong support for open-source projects. 

### Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

 A cloud-based environment, such as those provided by GitHub Actions or CircleCI, offers the advantage of minimal maintenance, scalability, and ease of setup. These platforms manage the infrastructure, allowing development teams to focus on their code rather than on maintaining servers. 
 
 A self-hosted CI environment, like a self-hosted Jenkins server, might be better for organizations with specific security,customization, etc. needs. It offers better control over the environment. To make an informed decision, you would need information on the project's security requirements, budget constraints, expected load etc.
